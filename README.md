This is a Random Facts Generator.
When the button is clicked, an http call requests data from the api ninjas website with a personal api key, and displays the random fact in the website.

The technology that was used to create this simple app is:
1. Javascript
2. Bootstrap

In the future Jquery will be added as well as Tailwind CSS will replace Bootstrap, in order to style the app further.
